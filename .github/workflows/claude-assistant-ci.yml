# Claude AI Assistant for Pull Request Reviews and Interactive Help
#
# Provides AI-powered code assistance via the Claude Code Action:
# - Interactive @claude mentions in comments, issues, and reviews
# - Automatic PR reviews with inline comments and progress tracking
#
# INTERACTIVE MODE (@claude mentions)
# ===================================
# Claude responds to @claude mentions in:
# - Issue comments and issue bodies
# - PR comments and review comments
# - PR review bodies
#
# Uses sticky comments to consolidate responses and loads project context
# from .agents/steering/ and CLAUDE.md before responding.
#
# AUTOMATIC PR REVIEW MODE
# ========================
# Automatically reviews all PRs (except those from bots) with focus on:
# 1. Safety - Security vulnerabilities, data integrity risks
# 2. Bugs - Runtime errors, edge cases, logic errors
# 3. Conventions - Contradictions with steering context or CLAUDE.md
# 4. Scope - Changes that don't belong in this repository
# 5. Cost - N+1 queries, unbounded loops, expensive operations
#
# Reviews use inline comments with code blocks showing suggested fixes.
#
# INCREMENTAL REVIEWS
# ===================
# When new commits are pushed to an existing PR:
# - Only reviews the new commits (not the entire PR)
# - Skips summary comment if no issues found (reduces noise)
# - Falls back to full review on force push (history rewritten)
#
# CONTEXTUAL SIGNALS
# ==================
# The workflow detects signals from the PR to adjust review focus:
#
# Breaking Changes:
# - Detected via conventional commits (feat!:, BREAKING CHANGE in body)
# - Triggers verification of: compatibility, migration docs, version bump
#
# Security-Sensitive Files:
# - Detected via path patterns (auth, crypto, token, permission, etc.)
# - Elevates scrutiny of: input validation, auth logic, secrets, OWASP risks
#

            INLINE COMMENT (for ALL issues):
            Post using mcp__github_inline_comment at the exact line.

            Format:
            ```
            **[TYPE]** Short title

            One sentence explanation.

            **Suggested fix:**
            ```lang
            corrected code
            ```
            ```

            TYPE is one of: SAFETY, BUG, CONVENTION, SCOPE, COST

            Example:
            ```
            **[BUG]** Null reference on undefined user

            Will throw TypeError when user lookup fails.

            **Suggested fix:**
            ```ts
            const name = user?.name ?? 'Unknown';
            ```
            ```

            ---

            SUMMARY COMMENT (posted once after all inline comments):
            Post using gh pr comment.

            Format:
            ```
            ### Review Summary
            One sentence: scope + risk level.

            **Issues:** N (see inline comments)

            Example - no issues:
