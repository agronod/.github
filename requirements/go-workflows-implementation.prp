# Product Requirements Prompt (PRP)

## FEATURE:
GitHub Actions workflows for Go - implementing CI, Pull Request, and Test workflows following the existing patterns for Node.js, Python, and .NET workflows in the repository.

## EXAMPLES:
- Existing workflow patterns in .github/workflows/:
  - node-ci.yml, node-pull-request.yml, node-test.yml
  - python-ci.yml, python-pull-request.yml, python-test.yml
  - dotnet-ci.yml, dotnet-pull-request.yml, dotnet-test.yml
- Reusable workflow pattern with inputs and secrets
- Consistent naming conventions and structure

## DOCUMENTATION:
- GitHub Actions documentation for Go
- Go official documentation for testing and building
- Existing workflow files in the repository as reference patterns
- Standard Go tools: go test, go build, go mod, golangci-lint

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:
- Follow the same pattern as existing language workflows (CI, Pull Request, Test)
- Use reusable workflows with appropriate inputs and secrets
- Include standard Go development practices (module management, testing, linting)
- Maintain consistency with existing workflow naming conventions
- Support multiple Go versions similar to how Node.js and Python workflows support multiple versions
- Include code coverage reporting
- Follow the existing pattern of using workflow_call for reusability
